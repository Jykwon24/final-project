('Chest', 'Bench', 'Bench toward the start of your chest workout for heavy sets in lower rep ranges, such as 5-8 reps. Vary your grip width and style for more complete chest development.'),

('Chest', 'Dumbbell Bench Press', 'At least some of the time, do flat dumbbell presses toward the start of your chest workout for heavy sets in lower rep ranges. They can also work well for high reps later in a chest workout, either flat or on an incline or decline.'),

('Chest', 'Incline Press', 'As a primary lift, a few heavy sets of 6-8 can be your bread and butter. As a secondary lift, up it to 8-10. Many chest workouts start with flat-bench movements first, but every so often you should start with inclines, particularly if you''re trying to bring up your upper chest.'),

('Chest', 'Push Ups', 'Sets of push-ups to failure are a great way to burn out or add volume in the late stages of a workout, and they''re awesome in a compound set with dips, a mechanical dropset after flyes or presses, or an antagonist chest-and-back superset with rows. Weighted push-ups and push-ups with resistance bands can even be a primary push movement, if needed.'),

('Chest', 'Cable cross-overs', 'The cable cross-over is an isolation movement that uses a cable stack to build bigger and stronger pectoral muscles. Since it''s done using adjustable pulleys, you can target different parts of your chest by setting the pulleys at different levels. It is common in upper-body and chest-focused muscle-building workouts, often as a pre-exhaust at the beginning of a workout or a finishing movement at the end.'),

('Chest', 'Dumbbell Flyes', 'Do your flyes after your presses, either as your first isolation move, or as the final exercise in your workout. There''s no need to go heavy! Stick to higher-rep sets, like 10-12 reps or slightly higher.'),

('Chest', 'Incline Dumbbell Flyes', 'The incline dumbbell chest fly is an upper-body exercise targeting the chest. Performing it at an incline helps to target the upper chest in particular, while limiting involvement of the shoulders. Fly variations are usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more.'),

('Chest', 'Weighted Dips', 'All types of dips hit the chest heavily, but on chest day, it''s worth making sure you''re doing dips that emphasize the pecs. Put your feet up behind you, lean forward as far as possible, and allow your elbows to flare out slightly as you dip.'),

('Back', 'Deadlift', 'The barbell deadlift is a compound exercise used to develop overall strength and size in the posterior chain. It is a competition lift in the sport of powerlifting, but is also considered a classic benchmark of overall strength. When performed with the hands outside the knees, it is often called a "conventional" deadlift. When the feet are wide and the hands are inside the knees, it is a sumo deadlift.'),

('Back', 'Bent Over Row', 'Do heavy bent-over rows toward the start of your back workout in lower rep ranges, such as 6-8 or 8-10, in order to save your lower back. If you''re wrecked from deadlifts, skip it or do it on a second back day later in the week.'),

('Back', 'T-Bar Row', 'Load the bar to an appropriate weight for your training. Stand astride the bar and bend at the hips to take a pronated grip on the handles. Ensure that your back remains flat, and then remove the weight from the rests, letting the bar hang at arms length. This will be your starting position. Perform the movement by flexing the elbows and retracting the shoulder blades, pulling the weight to your chest. After a brief pause at the top of the motion, return to the starting position.'),

('Back', 'Pull-Up', 'If you''re a pull-up pro, you can do some light sets as a warm-up. If they''re tougher for you, you can treat them more as a strength movement toward the start of your workout. Assisted variations make for great burnouts at the end of a back workout.'),

('Back', 'Seated Row', 'The cable seated row is a popular exercise to train the muscles of the upper back, including the lats (latissimus dorsi), traps, rhomboids, and rear deltoids, using a cable stack. It also targets the biceps to a lesser degree. The cable row can work well in a variety of rep-ranges, but is most popular in muscle-building workouts or as an accessory movement for strength workouts.'),

('Back', 'Lat Pull Down', 'Your first impulse may be to reach for the wide-grip bar, but back-focused EMG research suggests that use of a close neutral grip activates the lats similarly to a regular grip. This grip also allows for a longer range of motion and increased time under tension for the lats, which is great for building muscle. Slow down the rep tempo on these, squeeze hard at the bottom of each rep, and allow a good stretch at the top.'),

('Back', 'Single Arm Dumbbell Row', 'This is a "meat and potatoes" back exercise. Do it in the middle or end of your workout for sets of 8-12 or higher.'),

('Shoulders', 'Push Press', 'This doesn''t need to be an "every workout" move. When you do use it, perform it first in your workout, after warming up well, for 3-4 sets of 6-8 reps. Stop each set before fatigue causes your form to crack.'),

('Shoulders', 'Seated Dumbbell Press', 'Do it first in your workout for solid, heavy sets of 6-8 reps. Going heavy? Have a spotter help you get the weights into the starting position and give you a spot (or even a forced rep or two) as you push toward failure.'),

('Shoulders', 'Upright Row', 'Even though it''s technically a multijoint movement, don''t do this exercise first in your workout. Do it after your presses for 8-10 reps per set, in supersets with front raises, or as a burnout move at the end of your routine.'),

('Shoulders', 'Arnold Press', 'Named after the iconic bodybuilder and movie star, the Arnold press adds rotation to a classic shoulder press. It allows the hands to rotate naturally, while also hitting all three heads of the deltoids in one motion. It is usually performed  for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps or more, as part of the upper-body or shoulder-focused portion of a workout.'),

('Shoulders', 'Lateral Raises', 'If you really want to bring up your medial delts, do this exercise first; if your front or rear delts need more work, do this exercise last. In either case, do it for at least 8-10 reps per set. Every once in a while, maybe after a scoop of your favorite pre-workout, take this to the next level by running the rack.'),

('Shoulders', 'Front Raises', 'The alternating dumbbell front raise is a single-joint exercise targeting the shoulder muscles, particularly the front or anterior deltoids. Performing the movement one shoulder at a time gives a momentary rest to each side while the other is working, potentially allowing you to do more reps during each set. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per set, as part of an upper-body or shoulder-focused workout.'),

('Biceps', 'Barbell Curl', 'Hit your heavy curls at the beginning of your biceps workout when you can really challenge yourself with weight. For a bit more of a strength stimulus, choose a weight you can handle for about 6-8 reps, or even a classic size-and-strength rep range like 5x5. A common biceps blunder is rocking your body excessively on this movement. Keep it strict for the most part, especially when you''e going heavy.'),

('Biceps', 'Dumbbell Curl', 'Is this really any different than a barbell curl? That''s up to you. Sure, you can do the moves in basically the same way in the same workout, but we don''t recommend it. The real value of dumbbell curls is that they can be done a number of ways: standing or seated, with both arms or alternating, rotating your wrists into Zottman curls to work on your fearsome forearms, or twisting that pinky up to focus purely on the bis. In short, you have options.'),

('Biceps', 'Chin-Up', 'If you train back with biceps, this exercise could make a great bridge movement between the two body parts for 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps. It can also be your primary upper-back and biceps move in a home workout.'),

('Biceps', 'Incline Curl', 'Perform these after an exercise like standing curls, in which both biceps heads are targeted with heavy weight. Because of the "overstretched" arm position at the bottom of the movement, it''s best done with relatively light weights and at least 8-12 reps per set.'),

('Biceps', 'Hammer Curl', 'Hammer curls are usually done in the middle or at the end of a workout in a classic rep range of 8-12 reps. Experiment with isometric holds to create a deep burn.'),

('Triceps', 'Skullcrushers', 'After warming up your elbows, perform 3-4 sets for 8-12 reps as the first or second exercise in your routine. Don''t be a hero and risk your skull! Hit your reps and it''ll help you build tris to match your bis.'),

('Triceps', 'Triceps Dip', 'You can start your triceps workout with dips if they''re tough for you. Otherwise, use them in the middle of your workout to pump those arms full of blood. Shoot for 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps.'),

('Triceps', 'Close-Grip Bench Press', 'Perform this movement first or second in your workout. Do 3-4 sets of 6-10 reps. If you''re going heavy, don''t hesitate to use wrist wraps for extra support.'),

('Triceps', 'Cable Push Downs', 'Since this is a single-joint or "isolation" exercise, do it toward the end of your workout for 3 sets of 10-12 reps or slightly higher.'),

('Triceps', 'Close-Grip Push-Up', 'Do this as a finishing exercise. If sets from your toes are too easy, put your feet up on a bench or have a partner put a weight plate on your back.'),

('Triceps', 'Single-Arm Cable Kick-Back', 'The single-arm cable triceps kick-back is an isolation exercise that targets the triceps. This is a common burnout move performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of an upper-body or arm-focused workout.'),

('Core', 'Hanging Knee Raises', 'Do this move first or second in your routine for 3 sets of 10-15 reps, or however many reps you can do. If using a medicine ball, try a dropset simply by letting go of the medicine ball when you hit failure.'),

('Core', 'Machine Crunch', 'This works great as one of the first exercises in your ab routine. Use a challenging weight for a lower rep target. Of course, it also works with lighter weight as a burnout at the end. In either case, 3-4 sets of 10-15 reps is a solid formula.'),

('Core', 'Russian Twists', 'Do this exercise toward the middle of your routine for 3 sets of around 15 reps per side. Increase the degree of difficulty by extending your arms out or using heavier weight.'),

('Core', 'Ab Roll-Out', 'Build up to 3 sets of 8-12 reps, rolling all the way out and back on your knees. If you can''t do all the reps prescribed or if your back is arching, reduce the distance and maintain a neutral spine, then slowly work to extend it over a few weeks.'),

('Core', 'Plank', 'You can do these last on ab day, but you can also do them at home just about any time you want. Since it''s an isometric move, shoot for time rather than reps. Doing 3-5 sets of 30-90 seconds in whatever variation is toughest for you should get you shaking!'),

('Core', 'Pallof Press', 'Connect a standard handle to a tower, and if possible position the cable to shoulder height. With your side to the cable, grab the handle with both hands and step away from the tower. You should be approximately arms length away from the pulley, with the tension of the weight on the cable.With your feet positioned hip-width apart and knees slightly bent, hold the cable to the middle of your chest. This will be your starting position.Press the cable away from your chest, fully extending both arms. You core should be tight and engaged. Hold the repetition for several seconds before returning to the starting position.'),

('Core', 'Decline Crunch', 'Position this one later in your routine after you''ve built up some fatigue from a really challenging first exercise or two. Do 3 sets of 10-15 reps. If you find 15 reps too easy, simply increase the angle of decline or use a heavier ball or plate.'),

('Legs', 'Barbell Back Squat', 'For leg growth, do this movement first with several light warm-up sets, pyramiding up in weight, before attempting your heaviest weight for multiple sets. Classic rep schemes like 5x5 or 3x8-10 work great. Don''t be afraid to belt up if you''re going heavy.'),

('Legs', 'Lunges', 'In a traditional leg day, do 3 sets of 8-20 reps per side, going higher the later it is in your routine. As you reach muscle failure, jettison any weights and do a few more reps without them, like you would in a dropset.'),

('Legs', 'Leg Press', 'You can''t go wrong with 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps. Occasionally, when the pre-workout is flowing, do a few epic sets of 20-30 reps or more. This exercise also goes exceptionally well with intensity-boosting techniques such as rest-pause, dropsets, or forced reps.'),

('Legs', 'Leg Curls', 'Keep it simple: 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps, coming close to muscle failure. This is a low-risk, high-reward move, so occasionally add in some slow negatives or dropsets to make it more intense.'),

('Legs', 'Calf Raises', 'Stand upright holding two dumbbells by your sides and your shoulders back. Place the balls of your feet on an exercise step or a weight plate. Make sure your heels aren''t touching the floor. With your toes pointing forwards, raise your heels off the floor and contract your calves. Slowly return to the starting position.');
